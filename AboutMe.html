<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is DeVosha Patterson. I have worked in retail banking for accumulative of 10 years. I’m currently learning Java in a coding Bootcamp conducted by Grand Circus in Detroit, MI. I choose to learn coding because I love using my analytical and problem solving skills. The rush I feel when I figure how to get my code working properly and efficiently is like an adrenaline junkie jumping out of a plane. The road to this point has not been easy but I’m glad I’m here.</p>
